    <div class="Sonnet-1">
    From fairest creatures we desire increase, </br>
    That thereby beauty's rose might never die, </br>
    But as the riper should by time decease, </br>
    His tender heir might bear his memory: </br>
    But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes, </br>
    Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel, </br>
    Making a famine where abundance lies, </br>
    Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel: </br>
    Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament, </br>
    And only herald to the gaudy spring, </br>
    Within thine own bud buriest thy content, </br>
    And, tender churl, mak'st waste in niggarding: </br>
       Pity the world, or else this glutton be, </br>
       To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee. </br>

    <h1>Sonnet 2</h1>
    <div class="Sonnet-2">
    When forty winters shall besiege thy brow, </br>
    And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field, </br>
    Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now, </br>
    Will be a totter'd weed of small worth held: </br>
    Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies, </br>
    Where all the treasure of thy lusty days; </br>
    To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes, </br>
    Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise. </br>
    How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use, </br>
    If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine </br>
    Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,' </br>
    Proving his beauty by succession thine! </br>
       This were to be new made when thou art old, </br>
       And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold. </br>
